**Customer Churn Prediction**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms. Customer churn, also known as customer turnover, is a critical issue for businesses, resulting in significant revenue loss. This project utilizes Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest algorithms to identify high-risk customers.

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating additional relevant features.
3. Model Selection: Comparing performance of Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest algorithms.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using cross-validation.

**Models:**

**Logistic Regression**

- Description: A linear model for binary classification.
- Hyperparameters: Regularization (L1, L2), penalty term.

**Gradient Boosting**

- Description: An ensemble learning method combining multiple weak models.
- Hyperparameters: Learning rate, number of estimators, max depth.

**Random Forest**

- Description: An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees.
- Hyperparameters: Number of estimators, max depth, feature selection.

Results

- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Comparison: Performance comparison of the three models.
